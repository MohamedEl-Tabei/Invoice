# Invoice Application

**Invoice** is a full-stack web application built with **.NET** (backend) and **Angular** (frontend), designed to simplify shopping and budgeting.  

The backend exposes a secure and well-documented RESTful API, documented using **Scalar**, enabling developers to explore endpoints, test requests, and integrate quickly and efficiently.


The app helps users estimate their total expenses before shopping, and allows stores to list their products to attract more customers.
