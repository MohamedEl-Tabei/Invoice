# Invoice Application

**Invoice** is a full-stack web application built with **.NET** (backend) and **Angular** (frontend), designed to simplify shopping and budgeting.  
The backend exposes a secure and well-documented RESTful API, documented using **Scalar**, enabling developers to explore endpoints, test requests, and integrate quickly and efficiently.


The app helps users **estimate their total expenses before going out to buy products**, and allows stores to list their items and prices—making it easier for users to find what they need at the best price, and helping shops attract more customers.
